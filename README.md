### Overall System Architecture

The system comprises several interconnected components, each serving a specific role in the functionality of the application. The main components include:

- **Buyer Server Frontend**
- **Seller Server Frontend**
- **Buyer Server Backend**
- **Seller Server Backend**

The server frontends act as intermediaries, receiving requests from clients and establishing connections with the relevant database instances. The database instances consist of the Product Database and Customer Database, each managed by separate server backends. The flow of a typical request follows this sequence:

**Client** ---*REST Request*---> **Server Frontend** ---*gRPC Request + *---> **Target Backend Functionality** ---*MySQL Request*---> **Database Query**

**Target Backend Functionality** ---*SOAP Request*---> **Financial Server**

The current state of the application effectively supports all the functionalities outlined in the specification document. It operates under certain assumptions:

1. **Database Consistency:** Sellers and their corresponding items are linked through the seller ID, essentially forming a foreign key relationship. However, the application does not automatically handle the deletion of related objects when the reference object is deleted. Deletion is an independent operation performed by the server and may lack consistency in the event of node failure.

2. **Database Service Availability:** The system assumes that the backend database service is consistently operational before starting the server frontend service.

3. **Shopping Cart Handling:** The application assumes that the client is responsible for saving the cart when needed. It only retains changes made to the cart in memory until explicitly saved.

4. **Transaction History:** The user's transaction history is not stored as a timeline but rather as a snapshot of the cart when the "make purchase" functionality is invoked.

5. **Search Mechanism:** The buyer's search functionality attempts to match the existence of the exact keyword as a substring in the concatenated string of all keywords associated with a product.
